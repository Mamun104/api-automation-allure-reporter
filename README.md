![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53ee8886-498c-4715-9c3d-482e3ddef76d)

This project demonstrates **API automation** using Postman collections executed via **Newman** along with **Allure** for advanced Allure reporting. The project is designed to test user login, creation, update, and deletion functionalities with various scenarios, all wrapped in a beautiful report generated by **newman-reporter-allure**.

## 🏃‍♂️ **How to Run This Project**

1. **Clone the project** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. **Open the project** in Visual Studio Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

---

## 📦 **Install Dependencies**

1. **Install npm packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify the npm version**:
   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

---

## 🌐 **Install Newman**

To run Postman collections from the command line, install Newman globally:
```bash
npm install -g newman
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
newman -v
```

---

## ✨ **Install Newman Reporter-Allure**

This reporter provides extended Allure reporting functionalities.

1. **Global Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g newman-reporter-allure
   ```
---

## ⚙️ **Usage**

To generate Allure results, specify allure in Newman's -r or --reporters option.

```bash
     $ newman run <Collection> -e <Environment> -r allure
     $ newman run <Collection> -e <Environment> -r allure --reporter-allure-export <allure-results-out-dir>
```

Use the option --report-allure-collection-as-parent-suite to use the collection name as the parent suite title under the Suites view. This helps when you run multiple collections and want to aggregate them in a single report.

---

## Generating and Serving Allure report

Allure results will be generated under folder "allure-results" in the root location. Use allure-commandline to serve the report locally.

      $ allure serve
      
Generate the static report web-application folder using allure-commandline

       $ allure generate --clean
